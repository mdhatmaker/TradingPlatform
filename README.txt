STACKED ORDER BOOK

This project is the foundation for a working "stacked order" manager. Given the number of prices
levels to quote, create a "stack" of working orders (StackedOrderBook). This StackedOrderBook
attempts to maintain FIFO order priority at all times (by rotating through price levels,
managing multiple smaller orders to make up total qty at a price level, etc.)

All code except for the ThreadPool is my own (including the custom CircularArray). Ignore the
copyright notices that are auto-generated by XCode. Feel free to use anything here for your
own projects.

In building this project, I remembered the most difficult problem was that of dealing with
"in-flight" orders (possibility of receiving fills when attempting to modify an order, etc.)
For simplicity, I ignore in-flight issues in this version.

This project also contains a generic trading "interface". I will implement different versions
of a TradingEngine for different execution platforms. Initially, I will build one to interface with
the CTS T4 simulator, but it should be possible to build one for any API (including custom-built).

For now, only the MOST basic aspects of a TradingEngine are implemented to simulate order
price/qty modification in the simplest possible way. The output is a display of orders at
each of 5 price levels for both bids and asks (offers). After each manipulation (starting/stopping
active quoting, moving the stack price levels "in" or "out") we display whichever stacked order
book was modified so we can view its contents.

Directions for future capabilities to be added/implemented are listed in the sections below.

MISC NOTES

Modify [increase qty] => add order to StackLevel
Modify [decrease qty] => start by deleting newest orders until reach desired qty
Modify [change price] => this moves you to the back of the queue at the new price level
(try to do a modify of both price AND qty in a single mod request)
(add ability to separate price levels by single-tick OR multiple-tick)
(add ability to "reload" X number of times if our whole qty at a price level is filled)
(add ability to have different qty for inside price levels than non-inside price levels)
(what about a generic hedge ability when stacked orders are filled?)
(how to avoid price level "flickering" -- lower bid inside price then immediately raise bid inside price, etc.)

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

(done) Implement stacked order book levels with a CircularArray
(    ) Create an implementation of GenericTrading which interfaces with the Cunningham Trading T4 API (simulator)
(    ) Create a "position in queue" to calculate an order's' worst-case execution priority
(    ) What reject messages are needed?
(    ) What about a Callback for status updates (exchange status, instrument trading status, etc.)?
(    ) Launch thread that will randomly fill orders, move markets, etc
(    ) Should I change StackedOrderBook to StackedOrderSide and create new StackedOrderBook that is 2xStackedOrderSide (bid/ask sides)?
(    ) What about fuzzy/furry Fills? Are these just Trade callbacks that imply our order(s) filled?
(    ) What about PartialFill?
(    ) Allow for different quantities at different levels (i.e. different qty for inside market)
(    ) Allow for ability to "refill" a specifed number of times (i.e. re-enter orders at a price level if level is completely filled)
